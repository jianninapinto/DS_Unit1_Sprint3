# Data Science - Unit 1 Sprint 3 | BloomTech
## Sprint Challenge - Linear Algebra
### Welcome to the final Sprint Challenge of Unit 1!
In this challenge, we're going to explore two different datasets where you can demonstrate your skills with fitting linear regression models and practicing some of the linear algebra concepts you learned.

Make sure to follow the instructions in each task carefully! The autograded tests are very specific in that they are designed to test on the exact instructions.

Good luck!
